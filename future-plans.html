    <h2>Development of my Skills</h2>
    <p>One skill I believe I am very proficient in is decision making, problem solving and attention to detail. In aviation, it is extremely important to be able to come up with solutions on the spot in times of an emergency. Along with that, being able to process information quickly and make decisions as the pilot in command whether on what runway you will takeoff or land on is important. Attention to detail on your throttle or flap setting is extremely important too especially since sometimes, these small details are the difference between life and death. Applying these skills over and over again has made me confident in my abilities to problem solve and make quick good decisions when necessary. Academically, this helps me in homework assignments whenever I am stumped on a math problem or during a test when there is a problem that I have never seen before. For a career in engineering, being able to make decisions and goals in a timely and effective manner is important. Being able to solve problems efficiently is necessary in the engineering industry as part of the engineering process is making mistakes where problems can arise.</p>
    <p>One skill I believe I could work more on is my presentation skills. Sometimes I have the a small fear of presenting in front of many people. Performing in front of people during Solo & Ensemble in high school has helped ease the stage fright. At Texas A&M, I hope to present more whether that is in my engineering classes or a communication class. In the workforce, it is important to develop the presentation skills as it is a necessary skill.</p>
    <h2>Future Plans</h2>
    <p>My future plans are to be a leader in the aerospace design industry, where I can lead projects focused on propulsion systems of spacecraft, aerodynamics of aircraft and spacecraft and overall aerospace systems. Along with that, I hope to combine my leadership, engineering and aviation skills in which I can lead projects while also flying as flying is a huge passion of mine. Both of the skills above are necessary skills in order for me to succeed in the workforce as if I lead a project, I need to make sure I can make good decisions and solve problems effectively when they arise. If I am a test pilot, I need to make sure I can react quickly and come up with the best solution in the given scenario. In university, I hope to conduct aerospace research in either aerodynamics or propulsion systems with either professors or other students to broaden my horizon and gain more experience. For me, being able to operate the machine you design and study is important which makes me having a private pilot certificate very valuable. Learning the inside and outsides of not only how the machine theoretically works, but how it truly functions is important in engineering design and testing.</p>
